###Google News Timezone Adjuster is a Chrome Extension
(available [on the chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-news-timezone-adju/idpbkphamfbajncmgjecicbckhpmdgfi))

The extension does one thing- it adjusts the game times on news.google.com to match your system's timezone.

The Google News website has a section titled "Sports Scores" that lists today's games. The start times are all listed in Pacific Time and the site offers no option to customize the timezone. This extension is for users outside of the Pacific Timezone that wish to see game times listed in their local timezone.
